## C++ DSA Topics

### Core DSA Concepts

1. **Arrays and Vectors** - Basics of static and dynamic arrays using `std::vector`.
2. **Linked Lists** - Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks and Queues** - Data structures for linear data processing.
4. **Trees** - Binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
5. **Graphs** - Representations using adjacency lists and matrices.
6. **Hash Tables** - Implementing hash maps for efficient lookups.

### Advanced Algorithms

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Shortest path in a weighted graph.
2. **A* Algorithm** - Pathfinding with heuristic optimizations.
3. **RRT*** - Rapidly-exploring Random Tree for robotic pathfinding.
4. **Dynamic Programming** - Solving complex problems with overlapping subproblems.
5. **Divide and Conquer** - Breaking problems into smaller parts for efficient solutions.
6. **Greedy Algorithms** - Building optimal solutions step by step.
7. **Backtracking** - Exploring all possibilities for solving problems.
