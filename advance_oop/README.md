## C++ OOP Topics

### Core OOP Concepts

1. **Classes and Objects** - Understanding the basic structure of C++ classes and objects.
2. **Encapsulation** - Managing access to class members using private, protected, and public specifiers.
3. **Inheritance** - Reusing code and extending functionality through derived classes.
4. **Polymorphism** - Achieving runtime and compile-time polymorphism with virtual functions and function overloading.
5. **Abstraction** - Designing interfaces and abstract classes.
6. **Constructors and Destructors** - Managing object lifecycle and resource allocation.
7. **Static Members** - Shared class attributes and methods.
8. **Friend Functions** - Accessing private members from non-member functions.

### Advanced Features

1. **Operator Overloading** - Defining custom behavior for operators.
2. **Templates** - Generic programming with function and class templates.
3. **Virtual Functions** - Implementing runtime polymorphism using virtual tables.
4. **Smart Pointers** - Managing dynamic memory with `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`.
5. **Multiple Inheritance** - Combining features from multiple base classes.
6. **Namespaces** - Organizing code with namespaces.
7. **Exceptions** - Handling errors and exceptions with `try-catch` blocks.
8. **Move Semantics** - Optimizing performance with move constructors and `std::move`.
